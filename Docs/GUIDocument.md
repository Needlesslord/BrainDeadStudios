## Menus (Flow Diagram)

The following flowchart diagram is the technical description of how the menus will interact with each other, with all the buttons, etc.

## HUD


### Technical point of view

We are using tools to create a HUD with is inclusive, intuitive and easy to use. For example, the "Exit" button will be always at the end of the menu. 

With everything, the design we have come up with is the following for the inside-game experience:

## Screens Layout

Usability is key when developing games, but usually performed too late in the game development cycle. Therefore, with the information take from the paper ["Early Usability Evaluation in Model-Driven video Game Development"](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Screen-Navigation-metamodel_fig1_236153020), this is the strategy we are using in early stages of development. The following images below are taken from the mentioned paper above.
