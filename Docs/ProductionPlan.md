## Introducion

In this part of the documentation we are going to explain our Production Plan, how we approached the project and why we chose to do it this way.

## General Calendar

For the production of iur RTS, we arranged different ways to control the time of our members. Here are what we used:

 + **Personal time calendar:** We used an Excel to create a calendar. Each week, all the members should write when they have free time or when they don't. This was used to distribute the work evenly, taking into account personal issues and to set realistic goals.
 
 + **Calendar:** This is an overview of the whole project and how the Team Leader envisions the development of the project. It is adapted when deadlines are not met, by adding time, when strictly necessary.
 
 + **General Calendar:** We have a general calendar to have a log of what each member does in a week, the estimated time and the real time.

## Sprints and Milestones

Tools we used to keep up with the sprints:

+ **Objectives:** Each week, in a "long meeting", we set the objectives for that week. The week before of a delivery, we are going to do so every day. This is done to assure a controlled progression and even work distribution.

+ **Updates:** 3 different types of updates will be used
    - Long meetings (face-to-face): They will usually take place on Thursdays from 10.30 to 12.30 and Friday afternoons. Important decisions, relevant to the game, will be made there, with a general consensus to move forward an idea. Here we will work together towards a goal (a member can ask for help to do a part and we will discuss it together) and we will update other crew members on what everyone else is doing, wht they expect to do next and if they are having an issue with something.
    - Short meetings (face-to-face): The difference between this one and the previous one is time. These will be set to remind team members of what they have to do, to make damage-control prevention, etc., not to discuss important event of the development of the game. They will take place in-between classes or afterwards, with all the members if necessary, but usually in small groups
    - WhatsApp updates: These will be done almost everyday. If that same day there was a meeting, a summary of every topic and to-do lists will be shared, for both the members who couldn't attend and to remind everyone. If that same day there is an important Milestone, there will also be a long discussion about it and how to make it work in time. These 2 cases will be considered important information delivery days (shown in the Calendar in dark green to contrast). Also, this platform will be used to convey troubles, ask for help to other team members and to inform.

## Budget

For the Budget, we will take into consideration that some of the resources we use, which are important when developing a game and should be taken into account, we are using them for free or we are not actually spending moeny on them. This is a short list of examples to help picture which are the ones we are referring to:
  + Computers
  + Electricity
  + Software
  + Internet Connection
  + Transport
  
Therefore, we are going to consider only salaries for an expected duration of the project of 4 months:

| Members | Gross salary per month | Social Security | Total cost per project |
 ---------|------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
| Team Leader | 1500 | 1500 | 12000 |
| Lead Coder | 1200 | 1200 | 9600 |
| Lead Designer | 1200 | 1200 | 9600 |
| Lead Artist (Art+Music) | 1200 | 1200 | 9600 |
| Lead QA | 1200 | 1200 | 9600 |
| Lead UI | 1000 | 1000 | 8000 |
| Manager | 1000 | 1000 | 8000 |
| Coders/Designers/Artists/etc | 800 | 800 | 6400 |


That adds up to (taken into account that some people have different positions, we will consider the higher pay): 56800 € per project.


Taken into account that we should have an emergency found, we would add: 20000€


Therefore, rounding up, we would need founds of: 77000€
