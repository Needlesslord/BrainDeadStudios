## Introducion

In this part of the documentation we are going to explain our Production Plan, how we approached the project and why we chose to do it this way.


***


## General Calendar

For the production of iur RTS, we arranged different ways to control the time of our members. Here are what we used:

 + **Personal time calendar:** We used an Excel to create a calendar. Each week, all the members should write when they have free time or when they don't. This was used to distribute the work evenly, taking into account personal issues and to set realistic goals.
 
 ![Calendar-personal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/76265716-9d63be00-6265-11ea-9ef4-951be63a959d.PNG)
 
 + **Calendar:** This is an overview of the whole project and how the Team Leader envisions the development of the project. It is adapted when deadlines are not met, by adding time, when strictly necessary.
 
 + **General Calendar:** We have a general calendar to have a log of what each member does in a week, the estimated time and the real time.

  + **Gantt Chart:** A Gantt Chart will also be used to oversee the scope of the project and the original plan. For more information please refer to [Gantt Chart](https://github.com/Needlesslord/BrainDeadStudios/blob/master/Docs/ProductionPlan.md#gantt-chart).

## Sprints and Milestones

Tools we used to keep up with the sprints:

+ **Objectives:** Each week, in a "long meeting", we set the objectives for that week. The week before of a delivery, we are going to do so every day. This is done to assure a controlled progression and even work distribution.

+ **Updates:** 3 different types of updates will be used
    - *Long meetings (face-to-face):* They will usually take place on Thursdays from 10.30 to 12.30 and Friday afternoons. Important decisions, relevant to the game, will be made there, with a general consensus to move forward an idea. Here we will work together towards a goal (a member can ask for help to do a part and we will discuss it together) and we will update other crew members on what everyone else is doing, wht they expect to do next and if they are having an issue with something.
    - *Short meetings (face-to-face):* The difference between this one and the previous one is time. These will be set to remind team members of what they have to do, to make damage-control prevention, etc., not to discuss important event of the development of the game. They will take place in-between classes or afterwards, with all the members if necessary, but usually in small groups
    - *WhatsApp updates:* These will be done almost everyday. If that same day there was a meeting, a summary of every topic and to-do lists will be shared, for both the members who couldn't attend and to remind everyone. If that same day there is an important Milestone, there will also be a long discussion about it and how to make it work in time. These 2 cases will be considered important information delivery days (shown in the Calendar in dark green to contrast). Also, this platform will be used to convey troubles, ask for help to other team members and to inform.
    - Discord will be used as well if a member cannot attend a meeting or they have to take place another day
    
+ **Trello:** Trello will be used in order to keep track of what is done, what needs to be fixed, tested, to do next, etc. Each card will have a different colour tag (Yellow for "Meh", Orange for "Important" and Red for "ASAP"). To undertand the point of each task, here are the distribution awe are going to use:
     - Different lists: Deciding / Backlog / To Do Next / Doing / Testing / Bugs Found / Fixing / Done / Left Out
     - Colour code: Yellow / Orange / Red
     - Deadlines
     - Checklists and descriptions
     - Links to helpful information
     - Comments to keep up the progress, remind to work on that task or to speed up the development
     - Each member link to their tasks

+ **Builds:** Each Friday a build will be created in order to test the progress. To know more about the QA Plan, please check our [QA Workflow Document](https://github.com/Needlesslord/BrainDeadStudios/blob/master/Docs/QAWorkflow.md).

## Risk and Contingency List

Our intention is to not have any problems or the minimum possible in the development of our project. However, we are aware that some may come up without us foreseeing them, even with our organization and planification. Having this in mind, we have prepared possible situations which may be a risk for the development of the game and how to act so we can fix it as fast as possible to continue working.

| RISK | PROBABILITY | IMPACT | SOLUTION
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A member leaves the project | Really low | Really high | The tasks will be reassigned to the rest of the team and extra hours will have to be done to meet with the requirements of each sprint and milestone. Priorities will be changed: only the bare minimim to complete the project will be implemented and, afterwards, we will work on polishing and adding mechanics. In addition, the professor will be notified to take into account the situation. |
| A member doesn't work | Medium | Really High | First of all, we will talk to the member to understand what's their situation. If the situation continues, the professor will be notified to take into account the situation and evaluate together to decide what to do next. The tasks will be reassigned to the rest of the team and extra hours will have to be done to meet with the requirements of each sprint and milestone. Priorities will be changed: only the bare minimim to complete the project will be implemented and, afterwards, we will work on polishing and adding mechanics. |
| A member is sick | Medium-High | Low-Medium | The sprint will be adapted if the task can be postponed. In addition, some of their workload will be distributed to help with their recovery to meet the sprint or milestone. If needed, extra hours will be invested. |
| Objectives in a sprint are not met | Low-Medium | Low-Medium | Fisrt of all, if a member foresees that they cannot complete their tasks in time they have to let the Team Leader know so they can change and adpat the schedule and workload of each member. If that doesn't happen, the members should inform in the weekly meeting of their progress and, if they haven't met all the objective, talk about them: what they need, if they are having problems understanding something, etc. The task will be postponed for the following week if possible, if not, it will be redistributed within the team. |
| Objectives in a milestone are not met | Really Low | Very High | This is a difficult one since only the week before will be noticeable. Every member will be accountable and will put in extra hours and take other member's work who may need help to complete the milestone in time. However, Sprints will prevent the work from being uncompleted. In addition, all milestones are some days before the actual delivery, so this will grant us extra time. |
| Error in a commit | Medium | High | The  first one to notice will notify the Team Leader and QA Team so they can fix the problem with the previous commit. |
| Animations are not smooth or centered (sprites) | Low | Low | The Art Team will reopen the "Sprites" task in order to fix the spritsheets. They will test them and close the issue. Since they will also be doing code, their code workload will be redistributed within the team or postponed. |
| The scope planned for the project is too big | High | Low | The scope will be reduced. A document with the basic information/design needed for the game is available to know the priorities and to know where to cut if needed. |
| Software/Hardware malfunctions | Low | High | The Team Leader and said member will work together with CITM-TTC's computers and their workload will be redistributed or, if possible, postponed. |
| A part of the code is harder than expected to implement | Low-Medium | Medium | Team Leader, Design Lead and Code Lead will have a meeting to decide what to do with that part. If it is related with a unit/building/etc, it will be decided whether to keep it, discard it, or change it. Afterwards, a meeting with the team will be held to talk about the news and how the feel about them. |

## Gantt Chart

A Gantt Chart is used to have a better visualization of the plan and see how the project is comingg to be and at what pace. You can check it out [here]().

The image below shows the Gantt Chart up to the first milestone and delivery.

![Gantt Chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/76265719-9f2d8180-6265-11ea-9103-abceffc1c17c.PNG)

## Budget

For the Budget, we will take into consideration that some of the resources we use, which are important when developing a game and should be taken into account, we are using them for free or we are not actually spending moeny on them. This is a short list of examples to help picture which are the ones we are referring to:
  + Computers
  + Electricity
  + Software
  + Internet Connection
  + Transport
  
Therefore, we are going to consider only salaries for an expected duration of the project of 4 months:

| Members | Gross salary per month | Social Security | Total cost per project |
 ---------|------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
| Team Leader | 1500 | 1500 | 12000 |
| Lead Coder | 1200 | 1200 | 9600 |
| Lead Designer | 1200 | 1200 | 9600 |
| Lead Artist (Art+Music) | 1200 | 1200 | 9600 |
| Lead QA | 1200 | 1200 | 9600 |
| Lead UI | 1000 | 1000 | 8000 |
| Manager | 1000 | 1000 | 8000 |
| Coders/Designers/Artists/etc | 800 | 800 | 6400 |


That adds up to (taken into account that some people have different positions, we will consider the higher pay): 56800 € per project.


Taken into account that we should have an emergency found, we would add: 20000€


Therefore, rounding up, the founds for the **development phase** we would need would be: 77000€

For the **launching phase** we would hire top RTS streamers to promote our content and we would gift it to small streamers and general gaming streamers, we would need to pay digital vendors such as Steam or Origin (no physical copies would be launched at the start of production to avoid overcosts) and social media to promote our content. We believe we would need around: 50000€
