## Overview

"GAME NAME" is an isometric single player RTS game featuring a campaign with playable units, buildable structures and manageable resources where the player will have to fight against waves of enemies trying to destroy his base.

The game is located in a paint themed world where resources, units and buildings will be related to paint.


***


## Game Pillars

### Resource Management:
The player will have to manage resources and invest them in creating new units, building new defences and upgrading the base to be able to repel the enemy armies.

### Exploration: 
Exploring the map will reward the player with new resources and space to keep upgrading the base and adquiring new tools to defeat the enemy.

### Attack The Enemy Base: 
The player will also have to attack enemy bases distributed around the map, these bases will be protected by enemy units and will have to be destroyed to beat the game.

### Endless Waves:
Enemy waves will come constantly after a certain amount of time or specific actions are made by the player. The only way to stop them will be to destroy the enemy bases.


***


## Plot

After many years of peace and tranquility, citizens of the "WORLD NAME" began to lose their colours and turned into monocromatic beeings. This was due to a corruption created by Chroma-King when he invaded the land. We, as rulers of the country will have to defeat his monochromatic armies and defeat Chroma-King to recover the peace and tranquility of our land.

+ Debugging Controls (F1,F2,F3,etc.)
+ Shortcuts with different keys that allow the player to control his units more easily.

## Gameplay

### Objective
The main goal of the game is to destroy all enemy bases while you defend your own base from oposing armies. The enemy will attack the player with waves of enemies, each of them being stronger than the previous one.


### Player Win
The player has two ways of wining

If the player is able to manage resources correctly, defend his base from enemy attacks and build an army that can defeat all enemy bases, he will achieve victory.

He can also decide to defend the base from the enemy waves, and if he is succesfull defending his base from every single wave, he will achieve victory.

### Player Lose
The player will lose if his Main Building gets destroyed, this will happen if he is not able to defeat the enemy waves that attack his base.


### Main Gameplay Characteristics

**Build & Manage Your Base:** The player will be able to build and upgrade several buildings to strengthen his base by using resrouces that he will have to manage accordingly in order to defend from the enemy armies that will attack. 

**Command Armies:** The player will have at its disposal several  buildings to strengthen his army and attack the enemy to finally stop the continuous attacks from enemy armies.

**Enemy Waves:** The player will have to defend from several waves of enemies, with increasing difficulty as the game progresses. These waves will come at certain situations in the game such as the player destroying an enemy base, or after a certain amount of time.

**Explore the map:** The map is full of scarce resources that the player will be able to collect in order to reinforce his army or upgrade even further his base.


### Gameplay Systems

*Under construction**

### Balancing

The game will be balanced around the available resources. Each resource will be used in different things, and each of them will have different qualities. 

Paint will be the basic material which will be used all around the game. It will be an esenital component in different units or buildings from various tiers.

Wood will be the mid tier resource that will allow the player to have better units and buildings than the ones created with paint.

Metal Scrap is the late game tier that gives acces to some of the best units and buildings in the game. 

Finally Titanium will work as the ultra late game resource which will grant acces to elite units. It will be hard to find around the map and the player will have to think carefully on what to use it.

Overall stats and costs of units and buildings can't be decided yet because they haven't been teste. Once we have them we will uupdate this section.

## Maps


We have designed 3 different maps to give the player a little bit more freedom when playing and to make it more interesting. Each map will come with different passives which will affect the player in different ways. In addition, there is a recommended order, but it is not compulsory since the games are independent from each other. 

The recommended first level is the **Forest Map**. It has 2 passives: 
+ Fog reappears in the forest areas (areas with more than 4 trees)
+ Allied units have increased movement speed


![FOREST](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/76069450-2becec80-5f93-11ea-8f01-445eaafa043e.png)


The recommended second level is the **Volcanic Map**. It only has 1 passive:
+ Comets will fall from the sky, which will cause mild area-damage


![VOLCANIC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/76069447-2b545600-5f93-11ea-9f18-ee0a6ca13c15.png)


The recommended third level is the **Snow Map**. It has 1 passive, but it also affects units:
+ Allied units move slower
+ Some allied units will benefit from this map, others will be penalised (Ex: Ranged Units will have increased attack speed)


![SNOW](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/76069448-2becec80-5f93-11ea-9d33-c6432782b076.png)


The above representations are the technical point of view of the maps, with key points and the Hall. Below, you can find the finished maps.

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

### Fog of War

The Fog will be present through out the game. The following colours will let the player understand how it is:

+ **Black**: Areas not explored.
+ **Gray**: areas that have been explored but the player has not vision over (the player will need a vision turret or a unit there to regain vision)
+ **None**: Areas explored and within sight of the player, since it may have units or buildings.

At the start of the game, the minimap will be black except for the Hall and close area. All the other parts will be covered by the Fog of War. When the player moves around, the Fog of War will clear from the path of the player on both the minimap and the map. When the player leaves the area, after an amount of time, the Fog of War will reappear, this time gray.


### Player Base

The player will have a main building that will have to be protected at all cost. Around it resource and defensive buildings will be built by the player, inside a large are designated in the map. The player will be able to place buildings freely inside the base area. Only some buildings will be able to be placed outside it.

### Middle Areas

The map will be full of resources and elements that will affect how the player plays the game. It will give acces to different resource  nodes that using a resource building will allow them to gather those resources 

### Minimap

On the Top-left part of the screen, the HUD will contain a minimap. It will be black except from the area where the player is and grey where the player has explored. Building and allied units will be represented, but not enemies or spawners, neither Paint sources. It will always be displayed and updated as the player's units move.

## Tutorial

+ **MAIN GOAL:** Destroy all spawners.

### SUMMARY

There is an order to follow, because some things are more important at the beginning for growing faster. Depending on the map, the player will have a passive skill that will help him in the game.

Also, the player will choose just before the game starts if he wants to play the tutorial or not. It is recommended to do it if it is the first time playing the game, but it is up to the player.
