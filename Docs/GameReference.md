## Comparison with other games (genre)


Our game is based in the classic RTS formula of base and army management. But instead of doing a 1 Vs 1 game, we will be doing a wave defense game where the player manages it's base and army, but instead of fighting another player, he will fight againt enemy waves.

We don't intend to have some sort of revolucionary management system, we will be using regular resources which give acces to different buildings and units.

Some games that we are using as reference are:

- They are Billions

- Warcraft 3

- Starcraft 2

## Technical Profile

- RTS games don't ussually focus on high graphics because of the high amount of units and entities on screen, because of this requirements for these games are ussually not very high and don't ask for high graphical capacity. They may require average processing capacity to the amount of things happening on screen.

- They are a genre focused nearly always exclusively to PC due to having controls that don't fit into a regular controller as much as they do with mouse & keyboard.

## History

RTS games have been evolving over time, its origins come from turn based games, which later evolved into Real Time Strategy Game, once the player started to move more than one unit at a time, which finally turned into moving everything at the same time.

Some of the first RTS games were Utopia for Intellivision (1981), later came Dune II setting the standards to the modern idea of an RTS, followed by the first Warcraft game.Command & Conquer finally introduced all basic characteristics that all RTS games have right now such as multiple units with different roles, different buildings, several maps, etc. Finally RTS became a more well known genre with the release of Starcraft & Warcraft II.

## Plot and Narrative of the compared games

- They are Billions: The player has to defend his base from several waves of zombies, if he is able to survive all of them he wins the game.

- Warcraft 3 & Starcraft II: Both games have campaigns where they have to fulfill several missions in different maps. They also emphasize in Player vs Player games where the first player that destroys the other player's base wins.

- Our game will have a general plot similar to the one in They are Billions due to having similar enemy wave systems.
