## Comparison with other games (genre)


Our game is based in the classic RTS formula of base and army management. But instead of doing a 1 Vs 1 game, we will be doing a wave defense game where the player manages it's base and army, but instead of fighting another player, he will fight againt enemy waves.

Some games that we are using as reference are:

- They are Billions

- Warcraft 3

- Starcraft 2

## History

RTS games have been evolving over time, its origins come from turn based games, which later evolved into Real Time Strategy Game, once the player started to move more than one unit at a time, which finally turned into moving everything at the same time.

Some of the first RTS games were Utopia for Intellivision (1981), later came Dune II setting the standards to the modern idea of an RTS, followed by the first Warcraft game.Command & Conquer finally introduced all basic characteristics that all RTS games have right now such as multiple units with different roles, different buildings, several maps, etc. Finally RTS became a more well known genre with the release of Starcraft & Warcraft II.
