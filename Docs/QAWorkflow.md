## Introduction


In this section, the Quality Assurance (QA) plan, we'll be explaining the tools, methods, parameters and tests that we'll be using during the developement of our video game project.


***


## Tools Used


We will use Github issues as a tool to report bugs. In order to report a bug we just have to press the button “New issue”, and fill the template provided by the tool to describe everything about the bug, what happens, when it happens, complexity, priority… A label can be added, if necessary, to provide some more information about the bug. Each bug report, must follow all the specified parameters of our template.

## Milestone Delivery Protocol


### Internal Milestones


Every friday, we will make a build and on saturday, it will be tested in a QA test sesion. Finally the bugs will be fixed and retested between sunday and monday. In this sesion, the QA team and the Team Lead will test the game. Every two weeks, we will test the game with another team and see which aspects of our game can be improved with their help.


### External Milestones


All the external milestones will be organised a week before every delivery. This milestones will consist in a major QA test sesion where all the members of the team will take part in. After this milestones, the team will make the necessary changes in order to improve the game.

The deliveries are:

**Vertical Slice:** 22nd of April

**Alpha:** 19th of May

**Gold:** 1st-10th of June
