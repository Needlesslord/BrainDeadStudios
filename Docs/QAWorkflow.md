## Introduction


In this section, the Quality Assurance (QA) plan, we'll be explaining the tools, methods, parameters and tests that we'll be using during the developement of our video game project.


***


## Tools Used


We will use Github issues as a tool to report bugs. In order to report a bug we just have to press the button “New issue”, and fill the template provided by the tool to describe everything about the bug, what happens, when it happens, complexity, priority… A label can be added, if necessary, to provide some more information about the bug. Each bug report, must follow all the specified parameters of our template.

## Milestone Delivery Protocol


### Internal Milestones


Every friday, we will make a build and, on Saturday, it will be tested in a QA test sesion. Finally, the bugs will be fixed and retested between Sunday and Monday. In this session, the QA team and the Team Lead will test the game. Every two weeks, we will test the game with another team and see which aspects of our game can be improved with their help.


### External Milestones


All the external milestones will be organised a week before every delivery. This milestones will consist in a major QA test session where all the members of the team will take part in. After this milestones, the team will make the necessary changes in order to improve the game.

The deliveries are:

**Vertical Slice:** 22nd of April

**Alpha:** 19th of May

**Gold:** 1st-10th of June

## Bug Properties


For describing the bugs we will use a template like the following one:

![Image](Photos_Wiki/report.PNG)

+ **Bug:** Brief description about what happens.
+ **Status:** It tells if the bug has been fixed or it is still happening.
+ **Step by step:** It says how to arrive to the bug.
+ **Expected behaviour:** It is what it should happen.
+ **Type:**
  - A: Game breaking bug or bug that makes the game unplayable.
  - B: Bug that makes the game less playable as intended.
  - C: Aesthetic, graphical or audio bug.
+ **Priority:**
  - Urgent: Bug needs to be fixed immediately.
  - High: Bug needs to be fixed within a day or two. 
  - Regular: Bug needs to be fixed within a week.
  - Low: Bug needs to be fixed whenever there aren't any high or urgent bugs.
+ **Version:** The version of the build where the bug happens.

## Process for Quality Testing

## Process for Quality Assurance


### Internal QA Test


Every friday, a build will be made. This build will be tested with a QA test on saturdays. The normal tests will last approximately 1 hour while the big ones 1 hour and a half, more or less. All bugs must be reported using the template explained before with Github issues. After the session, the QA master will check that the reports have been well done and will pass all the informations to the members of the team. All bugs will be fixed during sundays and mondays.


### External QA Test


This test are similar than the internal QA tests, but instead of being done by members of the team, this test is performed by other people, in our case, other groups. This will help to find bugs the ones couldn’t be found by the members of the team.
