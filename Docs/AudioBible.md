## Audio Pillars


### Music

The style could be defined as "epic". The in game music tries to motivate the player while keeping up the tension and has to able to loop. 

However, for the menus, we chose a more casual, almost ballad, genre, but that can be recognised as typical adventure menu music. For the pause menu we kept that in mind while choosing a more soft way to make it easier for the player to know/remember they left the game on hold.

Finally, for the Win/Lose conditions we have a similar kind of epic/medieval style of music, but without the tension. While the Lose song has a more melancholic tone, the Win song has a happier mood. Both are also very intuitive.

Overall, the style could be considered epic and medieval, and classified as typical music used in Adveture RTS or RPG games.


#### Genre


#### Style

The style could be considered epic and medieval, and classified as typical music used in Adveture RTS or RPG games. For the menus, we could also define them as ballads. The FX try to match the vibe, avoiding futuristic sounds and trying to have more traditional and medieval related sounnds.


#### Instrumentation

A lot of drums are used, with Taikos (Japanese drums) also taking a lead role in some songs. Also, piano is key to the ballad type songs. A lot of computer software is used as well to mix the sounds. Other instruments have been used but they may not be as remarkable as these ones.

## Music Used


### Main Menu

Bith of a Hero - by Bensound

The music can be describes as an epic ballad typical in main menus where the player spends a short period of time.

Can be found [here](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/birth-of-a-hero): https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/birth-of-a-hero

### Pause Menu

Ophelia's Dream - by Bensound

It is a calm and melancholic song, to go along the pause of the game and to make the player notice/remember they put the game on hold.

Can be found [here](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/ofelias-dream): https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/ofelias-dream


### In Game

#### Map 1: Forest

Instinc - by Bensound

This music is perfect for the gameplay: it is repetitive, but with percussion, not monotonous; therefore, since we will loop it, it won't go unnoticed and won't bother the player.

Can be found [here](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/instinct): https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/instinct


#### Map 2: Volcanic

Evolution - by Bensound

This music is relatable to epic. The rythm will match the passive of the map, which is falling comets. It also admits loops

Can be found [here](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/evolution-epic-nature): https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/evolution-epic-nature

#### Map 3: Snow

Epic - by Bensound

This is also a very epic song, which, since the Snow Map could be considered the most difficult one, matches well the spirit and motivates the player, yet again, with a smooth loop.

Can be found [here](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/epic): https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/epic


### Others

#### Logo Animation

All That - by Bensound

Since it is for the logo animation, only the 4 first seconds have been used. It us urban/chill/jazzy, which matches the groovy/hip hop vibe of the logo.

Can be found [here](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/all-that-chill-hop): https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/all-that-chill-hop

#### Game Animation

The Duel - by Bensound

This song is not fast paced and doesn't catch the attention too much; therefore, it is perfect for the introduction of the game.

Can be found [here](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/the-duel): https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/the-duel

#### Win

Becoming An Angel - by Neil Cross

It is a happy song, which builds up the victory, with happy vibes, reminiscing of a semi-epic adventure and overcoming obstacles.

#### Lose

Defeat - by Jason Donnelly

It could be used as well for another map, but it has a sadder tone, as well as not the epic/fighting mood, rather just melancholic.

#### Lose

Fanfares - Short For Lost - by *Unknown*

This FX matches the theme of the Losing song, without overstepping and it is very intuitive
